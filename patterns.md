The pattern used is MVC(Modal View Controller);


The end points work in the following way

[GET] localhost:3000/api/category  //fetching all categories
[POST] localhost:3000/api/category  //posting a new category to the database
[DELETE] localhost:3000/api/category?name=any category name  //deleting a category
[PUT]localhost:3000/api/category   //editing  a category
